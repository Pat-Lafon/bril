# DBRIL

Bril stuff, but implemented using Salsa to act like a querying database

This Salsa-2022 is heavily under development. Expect a lot of documentation and
such to be broken... go with the flow and look at the calculator example <https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/blob/master/examples/calc/ir.rs>

The tutorial may or may not be relevant: <https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa/tutorial/ir.html>

## LSP

<https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/wit-lsp>

This guy wrote an LSP using salsa... that's pretty f*cking cool.
